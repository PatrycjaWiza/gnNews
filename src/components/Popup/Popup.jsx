              The most enjoable for me is to find a logic path to accomplish
              certain task. Seeing then results of clickable application makes
              me very satisfied and happy of my work. This is what moves me
              forward and motivates. <br />
              <br /> The hardest for me right now is Redux, so many requirements
              which at the beginning may be somehow confusing... However I do
              understand the easiness of using one store in more complex
              projects when passing through props between components can be a
              burden.

              <br />I am excited to see myself becoming experienced (fluent)
